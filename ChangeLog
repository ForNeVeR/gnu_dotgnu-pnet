	* all: initial check-in of the "pnetC" library.

	* doc/HACKING, README: describe how to build and contribute
	to the "pnetC" library.

	* configure.in, include/Makefile.am, include/unistd.h,
	include/sys/types.h, libc/Makefile.am, libc/unistd/.cvsignore,
	libc/unistd/Makefile.am, libc/unistd/chown-stub.c,
	libc/unistd/fake-ids.h, libc/unistd/guid-stub.c, libc/unistd/isatty.c
	libc/unistd/pid-stub.c: stub out unistd functions that deal with
	user, group, and process ID's, because they are insecure otherwise.
