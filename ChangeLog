* runtime/System/*.cs, resources/en_US/runtime/*.txt: many changes to
round out the implementation of the "System" namespace.  Too many
to enumerate them all here.

* configure.in: update version to 0.0.5.

* runtime/System/Radix.cs: remove "System.Radix", which is no longer

re-implement "System.Math" and "System.Random".

* runtime/System/Environment.cs: declare "TickCount" as "static".
