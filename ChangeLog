	* support/spawn.c (ILSpawnProcess): pass the first few options
	directly on the command-line instead of in the response file.

	* csant/csant_cscc.c (BuildCscCommandLine): pass "/noconfig" in
	addition to "/nostdlib" to csc, because "/nostdlib" only turns
	off mscorlib.dll, and not all standard libraries.

	* samples/I18N.CJK.dll, samples/I18N.MidEast.dll,
	samples/I18N.Other.dll, samples/I18N.Rare.dll,
	samples/I18N.West.dll, samples/I18N.dll,
	samples/Makefile.am, samples/System.Xml.dll,
	samples/System.dll, samples/mscorlib.dll: new versions after
	fixing build problems with System and System.Xml.

	* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog-2: move the contents of "ChangeLog" to
	"doc/ChangeLog-2", because it was starting to get too big to manage.

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_dasm.c: profile "wide" instructions.

	* engine/cvm.h, engine/cvm_dasm.c, engine/cvm_ptr.c, engine/cvmc.c,
	engine/cvmc_obj.c, engine/null_coder.c, engine/verify_var.c,
	include/il_coder.h: introduce the "pread_this" and "iread_this"
	instructions into CVM to optimise the common cases of accessing
	fields relative to "this".

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_call.c, engine/cvmc.c, engine/ilrun.c,
	engine/method_cache.c, engine/method_cache.h, image/program.h:
	implement method profiling in the engine to get a picture of
	which methods in pnetlib are highly used.
