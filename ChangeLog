	* engine/cvmc_setup.c (CVMCoder_SetupExternCtor): wrong return
	value if we don't have an allocating constructor.

	* engine/cvmc_var.c, engine/layout.c: handle "typedref"
	values correctly.

2002-05-15  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* cscc/cscc.c: "-fsave-asm" saves the assembly output even if
	the assembler fails.

	* ilalink/link_class.c, ilalink/link_create.c, ilasm/ilasm_build.c,
	ildasm/ildasm_class.c, image/class.c, image/meta_build.c,

	and related support code.

	* ildasm/ildasm_java.c, ildasm/ildasm_method.c, image/opcodes.c,
	include/il_opcodes.h: remove the "IL_OPCODE_ARGS_UNSAFE" value,
	because it is not strictly accurate.

	* engine/cvmc.c, engine/cvmc_call.c, engine/null_coder.c,
	engine/verify_call.c, engine/verify_obj.c, include/il_coder.h:
	verification of vararg method calls.

	engine/cvmc.c, engine/cvmc_call.c, engine/cvmc_obj.c,
	engine/cvmc_setup.c: add the "pack_varargs" CVM instruction to
	repack the stack when calling a vararg method.

	* support/test_float.c, engine/cvm_arith.c: add #ifdef's for hpux,
	which uses "isfinite" instead of "finite".

	engine/cvmc_call.c: collapse "call" and "call_extern" into a
	single "call" instruction; look for a cached method entry point
	in "call_ctor"; use the correct number of parameter words when
	collapsing the stack for tail calls.

2002-05-14  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	* engine/cvm_call.c, engine/cvm_except.c, engine/engine.h:

	of exception handling slightly.

	* include/il_values.h: remove parentheses that were causing
	build breakages on MacOSX.

	* csdoc/Makefile.am: move "csdocvalil", "csdoc2stub", and

	engine/internal.c, engine/layout.c, engine/lib_array.c,
	engine/pinvoke.c, ilnative/ilcheck.c: modify the engine to handle

	as it causes problems on hpux/gcc systems.

2002-05-13  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	is not portable to all shells.

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, include/il_config.h.in,
	engine/mklabel.sh: detect PIC and non-PIC forms of computed
	goto's separately because older versions of gcc only support
	the non-PIC form.

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/mklabel.sh: make instruction debugging
	work in the presence of computed goto's.

	* engine/mklabel.sh: modify the awk scripts to work around versions

	computed goto support during configuration.

	* engine/HACKING, engine/Makefile.am, engine/asmfix.c: remove

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_call.c, engine/cvm_except.c,
	engine/engine.h, engine/lib_array.c, engine/thread.c:
	convert the "frame" variable in the thread object and call frames
	into a pointer because it is more efficient than a relative offset.

	* engine/cvm_call.c: don't reset "thread->exceptHeight" on entry
	to a method because it will be overwritten if it is needed anyway;
	add some assembly hacks to prevent gcc getting overeager when
	it optimises the method call code.

	for IL 'tail. call' sequence.  Note that tail. does not 
	yes support 'calli' or 'callvirt' instructions, which 
	is OK by ECMA-335.  

	* engine/ilrun.c:  When argument parsing throws an
	exception, print it out using the standard mechanisms.

2002-05-10  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

	for synthetic types and synthetic uses of "System.Array".

	* codegen/cg_stmt.tc, codegen/jv_stmt.tc (ILNode_If): do not
	generate branch instructions at the end of a "then" clause if
	it ends with a "return" statement, because it will cause incorrect
	code generation if the "else" clause also ends with a "return".

	* codegen/cg_logical.tc, codegen/jv_logical.tc (ILNode_LogicalNot):
	reversed test in "GenValue".

	support/Makefile.am, support/no_thread.c, support/pt_include.h,
	support/pt_thread.c: begin adding threading primitives, based
	on pthreads.

	* codegen/cg_gen.c, codegen/cg_gen.h, cscc/common/cc_main.c:
	never use the ".library" builtin unless the "-fbuiltin-library"
	command-line option is supplied; create AssemblyRef's for all
	libraries that are specified by "-l" options.

	* cscc/csharp/cs_decls.tc: add the "beforefieldinit" flag to
	classes that need it.

	* codegen/cg_gen.c, codegen/cg_gen.h, codegen/cg_output.c,
	cscc/common/cc_errors.c: add security attributes to the output
	image if unsafe constructs are used in the source program.

	* image/meta_build.c (Load_MemberRef): scan up the class
	hierarchy to resolve a member because C# compilers output
	the direct parent class in "base.X" expressions, even if
	"X" lives in an indirect ancestor.

	* csdoc/doc_backend.h, csdoc/doc_main.c, csdoc/doc_valil.c,
	csdoc/status.sh: process multiple "-fimage" options in "csdocvalil".

	* csdoc/doc_test.c : Test stubber for ECMA classes , added
	csdoc2test to create stub test classes.

	* support/spawn.c (ILSpawnProcess): pass the first few options
	directly on the command-line instead of in the response file.

	* csant/csant_cscc.c (BuildCscCommandLine): pass "/noconfig" in
	addition to "/nostdlib" to csc, because "/nostdlib" only turns
	off mscorlib.dll, and not all standard libraries.

	* samples/I18N.CJK.dll, samples/I18N.MidEast.dll,
	samples/I18N.Other.dll, samples/I18N.Rare.dll,
	samples/I18N.West.dll, samples/I18N.dll,
	samples/Makefile.am, samples/System.Xml.dll,
	samples/System.dll, samples/mscorlib.dll: new versions after
	fixing build problems with System and System.Xml.

	* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog-2: move the contents of "ChangeLog" to
	"doc/ChangeLog-2", because it was starting to get too big to manage.

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_dasm.c: profile "wide" instructions.

	* engine/cvm.h, engine/cvm_dasm.c, engine/cvm_ptr.c, engine/cvmc.c,
	engine/cvmc_obj.c, engine/null_coder.c, engine/verify_var.c,
	include/il_coder.h: introduce the "pread_this" and "iread_this"
	instructions into CVM to optimise the common cases of accessing
	fields relative to "this".

	* engine/cvm.c, engine/cvm_call.c, engine/cvmc.c, engine/ilrun.c,
	engine/method_cache.c, engine/method_cache.h, image/program.h:
	implement method profiling in the engine to get a picture of
	which methods in pnetlib are highly used.
