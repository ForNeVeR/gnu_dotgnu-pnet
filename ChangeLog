* engine/verify_arith.c, engine/verify_const.c, engine/verify_ptr.c,
engine/verify_branch.c, engine/verify_conv.c: make sure that the
"typeInfo" part of a stack item is zeroed after arithmetic instructions.
This is needed to prevent confusion between "I" used as numeric,
pointer, and delegate types.

* engine/verify.c: modify "TypeToEngineType" and "AssignCompatible"
to pass method pointers around the system as type "I".

* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog-1: move the contents of "ChangeLog" to
"doc/ChangeLog-1", because it was starting to get too big to manage.
