* etc/c_skel.c, etc/cpp_skel.cc: swap the order of "data__" and "next__"

properly aligned on 64-bit platforms.

tests/output5.out, tests/output6.out, tests/output7.out, tests/output8.out,
tests/output9.out: new test output files that were affected by the
skeleton change.

Solaris.

tests/output5.out, tests/output6.out, tests/output7.out, tests/output8.out,
tests/output9.out: new test output files that were affected by the
skeleton change.

* doc/treecc.texi: insert a "@page" command to force the index to
be formatted correctly when PDF documentation is generated.
