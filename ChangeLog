* configure.in, NEWS: update version and news for 0.0.6 release.

2001-10-28  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* runtime/System/Console.cs: remove the temporary code in "Console" that
caused it to call "Platform.Stdio" directly, rather than go through the
"System.IO.TextWriter" class.

* runtime/System/String.cs: mark some of the constructors as non-CLS;
uncomment the "sbyte*" constructor since "Encoding" now exists; fix
the indexing for "IndexOf", "LastIndexOf"; implement "EqualRange",
"Split", and "Trim".

2001-10-27  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* runtime/System/Reflection/*.cs: many new reflection classes.

* runtime/System/AssemblyLoadEventHandler.cs,
runtime/System/UnhandledExceptionEventHandler.cs: new "System" classes.

* runtime/System/DefaultBinder.cs: stub out abstract methods that
are inherited from "Binder".

* runtime/System/RuntimeType.cs: make "privateData" internal so that
it can be accessed from the reflection classes; implement methods and
properties that are inherited from "MemberInfo".

* runtime/System/Makefile.am: add the new classes to the build.

* resources/en_US/runtime/Exception.txt: default error messages for
the new exception classes.

2001-10-24  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* runtime/System/RuntimeType.cs: Use "InternalGetFullName" for the "ToString"
method on "System.RuntimeType".

* runtime/System/Decimal.cs: Rearrange the field order to match that
used by other C# library implementors.

* runtime/System/RuntimeType.cs: remove "InternalGetAssemblyQualifiedName"
and synthesise its behaviour using "FullName" and "Assembly".

2001-10-23  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* runtime/System/*.cs, resources/en_US/runtime/*.txt: many changes to
round out the implementation of the "System" namespace.  Too many
to enumerate them all here.

2001-10-21  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* configure.in: update version to 0.0.5.

* runtime/System/Radix.cs: remove "System.Radix", which is no longer
part of the ECMA standard.

* runtime/System/Math.cs, runtime/System/Random.cs, runtime/System/Makefile.am:
re-implement "System.Math" and "System.Random".

* runtime/System/Environment.cs: declare "TickCount" as "static".

* resources/en_US/runtime/Arg.txt: new error messages for "Math" and "Random".
