	* csharp/class/field2.cs, csharp/class.field2.il,
	csharp/class/field2.jl: add tests for "volatile" fields.

	* csharp/stmt/return1.cs: bug in C# test case - cannot use
	"abstract" and "virtual" together.

	* csharp/class/Makefile.am, csharp/class/property2.cs,
	csharp/class/property2.il, csharp/class/property2.jl:
	test abstract property accessors.
