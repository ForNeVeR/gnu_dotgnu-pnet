caused it to call "Platform.Stdio" directly, rather than go through the
"System.IO.TextWriter" class.

the new exception classes.

used by other C# library implementors.

and synthesise its behaviour using "FullName" and "Assembly".

2001-10-23  Rhys Weatherley  <rweather@southern-storm.com.au>

* runtime/System/*.cs, resources/en_US/runtime/*.txt: many changes to
round out the implementation of the "System" namespace.  Too many
