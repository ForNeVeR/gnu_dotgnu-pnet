The classes in this directory implement generic counterparts to the
non-generic classes in the "System.Collections" namespace, plus some
extras that are modelled on the C++ Standard Template Library.

See the file "Generics.html" for a description of the design considerations
and an overview of the classes provided.

The license on these classes is the MIT X11 license.  This license
was chosen to maximize the number of people who can use the generic
class library.  We only ask that if you fix bugs or add new functionality
that you consider contributing the changes back to the Portable.NET
development team, but this isn't mandatory.
