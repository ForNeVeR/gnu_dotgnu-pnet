The classes in this directory implement generic counterparts to the
non-generic classes in the "System.Collections" namespace, plus some
extras that are modelled on the C++ Standard Template Library.

Also included are a number of "Adapter" classes, that can be used to
convert a generic collection into a non-generic collection.  This is
useful when trying to use generic collections with existing API's
that expect a non-generic collection.

Finally, there are a number of "Wrapper" classes that can be used to
convert a non-generic collection into a generic collection.  This is
useful to get a type-safe interface to an existing non-generic
collection class.

The license on these classes is the MIT X11 license.  This license
was chosen to maximize the number of people who can use the generic
class library.  We only ask that if you fix bugs or add new functionality
that you consider contributing the changes back to the Portable.NET
development team, but this isn't mandatory.
