0.0.6 (28 December 2001)

	* Swap the order of some fields in "YYNODESTATE" to align nodes
	  better on 64-bit platforms.
	* Fix a bug which prevented treecc from creating default output
	  files if "%output" and "%header" were missing from the source.
	* Bug fix in the singleton code: missing '*' in return case.
	* Add an option for kind values in either the node or the vtable.
	  Vtable kinds can help reduce memory requirements.
	* Bug fix to the skeleton expansion code: "yy" was not being
	  properly expanded to the specified prefix.
	* Implement the "%split" flag for non-virtual operations to split
	  large "switch" statements across multiple functions.  This should
	  help alleviate optimisation problems when compiling Portable.NET's
	  C# compiler with GCC 3.0.

0.0.4 (8 November 2001)

	* Modify the skeleton files so that tree nodes are aligned correctly
	  on 64-bit Solaris systems.
	* Slight documentation and GNU-compliance updates.
	* New version numbering scheme.
