0.1.0 (27 November 2001)

	* Continue documentation of native methods.
	* Implement "System.Diagnostics" and "System.Text".
	* Handle exception stack traces.
	* Timezone handling for dealing with UTC vs local time issues.

0.0.8 (17 November 2001)

	* New classes in "System.Resources", "System.Threading",
	  "System.Runtime.CompilerServices", and "System.Runtime.InteropServices".
	* Bug fixes in "DateTime".
	* New comparison functions in "String".
	* Uncomment the "Write" methods in "System.IO.TextWriter" because
	  we have the requisite support methods now.
	* Use "CompilerServices.MethodImplAttribute" instead of the one
	  in "InteropServices", to be consistent with the ECMA specification.
	* Remove some obsolete classes.
	* Convert the "native.txt" file into HTML and add some more information.

0.0.6 (3 November 2001)

	* Remove "System.Radix", which is no longer ECMA-compliant.
	* Re-implement "Math" and "Random".
	* Round out the "System" namespace.  Most ECMA classes are present,
	  even if only in stub form.
	* Implement a number of reflection-related classes.
	* Change some "internalcall" methods to C# in "System.String".
	* Remove a temporary hack in "System.Console" that caused it to
	  bypass the stream subsystem.  Virtual methods work in "pnet" now,
	  so we can use streams.

0.0.4 (20 October 2001)

	* Rewrote the "System.Collections" classes.
	* A few more classes in "System", particularly array and string related.
	* Implement enough of "System.Console" and "System.IO" to get
	  "Hello World" style print examples working.

0.0.2 (6 August 2001)

	* Update classes so that the library compiles with Microsoft's
	  Beta 2 compiler.
	* A handful classes within the "System" namespace, and stubs for
	  classes that "System" depends upon elsewhere.

0.0.1 (9 April 2001)

	* Initial release.  Library split from the main Portable.NET tree.
	* Separate resource area created.
	* Structure of Makefile's and build logic created.
	* Integrated some contributions from Mike Krueger.
	* Implemented a large number of classes from "System", together with
	  skeletons from other namespaces to make the source compile correctly.
