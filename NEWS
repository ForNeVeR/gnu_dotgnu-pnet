0.1.2 (27 June 2002)

	* Add some patches to support out of tree builds (Stephen Compall).
	* Make the build system more automake 1.5 friendly.
	* Work around versions of "sed" that don't support "-" for stdin.

0.1.0 (20 April 2002)

	* Add maintainer mode to the autoconf system to work around
	  autotools version problems.

0.0.8 (27 March 2002)

	* ANSI C compatiblity fixes.
	* Only build "expr_cpp" if bison is being used because "byacc"
	  does not understand the options used in the C++ grammar.
	* Polish the Texinfo documentation a little.
	* Fix the C++ skeleton to use "size_t" in the declaration of "alloc".
	* Implement the "strip_filenames" option to improve the predictability
	  of code generation in Portable.NET's C# compiler.
	* Add the "auto_gen.sh" and "conf_fix.sh" scripts.
	* Add the "essay.html" file to the documentation directory.

0.0.6 (28 December 2001)

	* Swap the order of some fields in "YYNODESTATE" to align nodes
	  better on 64-bit platforms.
	* Fix a bug which prevented treecc from creating default output
	  files if "%output" and "%header" were missing from the source.
	* Bug fix in the singleton code: missing '*' in return case.
	* Add an option for kind values in either the node or the vtable.
	  Vtable kinds can help reduce memory requirements.
	* Bug fix to the skeleton expansion code: "yy" was not being
	  properly expanded to the specified prefix.
	* Implement the "%split" flag for non-virtual operations to split
	  large "switch" statements across multiple functions.  This should
	  help alleviate optimisation problems when compiling Portable.NET's
	  C# compiler with GCC 3.0.

0.0.4 (8 November 2001)

	* Modify the skeleton files so that tree nodes are aligned correctly
	  on 64-bit Solaris systems.
	* Slight documentation and GNU-compliance updates.
	* New version numbering scheme.
