DotGNU Portable.NET Library
---------------------------

This distribution contains an implementation of the C# library, for use
with .NET-capable runtime engines and applications.  Originally designed
for DotGNU Portable.NET (http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html),
this library can be used by other .NET development efforts also.

DotGNU Portable.NET Library is part of the GNU project, developed
as part of the DotGNU (http://www.dotgnu.org/) meta-project.

The source code for the library is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License, with the following exception: if you link
this library against your own program, then you do not need to release
the source code for that program.  However, any changes that you make
to the library itself, or to any native methods upon which the library
relies, must be re-distributed in accordance with the terms of the GPL.

Contributions are welcome.  You must release your code under the terms
of the GPL, and you must also agree to allow your code to be used with
the above exception.  For more information, see the file "HACKING".

Building the Library
--------------------

The "configure" script understands the following options:

    --with-pnet=DIR

        Specify the location of the Portable.NET source tree.
        It is assumed that this directory contains compiled versions
        of programs such as "cscc" and "resgen", which are used when
        building the library.

        If this option is not specified, then "configure" will look
        in "../pnet", and then along the path, for the programs that
        it needs.

        If "configure" does not find any evidence of Portable.NET
        on the system, it will look for Microsoft's tools instead.

    --with-mstools

        Force "configure" to use Microsoft tools, even if Portable.NET
        is installed on the same system.

When building under Windows, you will need to have Cygwin installed
to provide the GNU-compatible toolchain that the scripts and Makefile's
use.  Cygwin is available for download from "http://cygwin.redhat.com/".

Roadmap
-------

The directories contain the following:

    runtime    Implementation of the core classes that make up
               what Microsoft calls "mscorlib".
    doc        Documentation, including the list of native methods that
               a runtime engine must supply to use "runtime", and a
               set of coding guidelines for contributions.
    resources  Resource files for translatable strings in the library.
               There are subdirectories for each supported language.
    tools      Repository for random scripts used by the build system.
    csunit     Implementation of the unit test framework for pnetlib.
    tests      Individual unit tests for the classes in pnetlib.
