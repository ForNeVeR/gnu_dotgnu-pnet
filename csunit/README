What is CSUnit?
--------------

CSUnit is a stripped-down unit testing framework, based loosely on
JUnit and NUnit.  It doesn't have a fancy UI, as it is designed for
batch testing within an automake framework.

CSUnit also is very conservative as to the features it uses from the
C# system library.  It tries not to rely upon the library for critical
data structures, because the library data structures may not work yet!
This makes CSUnit more suitable for self-testing the C# library than
the more general-purpose frameworks.

Why not use NUnit?
-----------------

The pnetlib package is part of the GNU project, and as such we must
use GPL-compatible software at all times.  NUnit's license doesn't
appear to be compatible with the GPL.
