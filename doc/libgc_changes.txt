When libgc is compiled under cygwin, GC_CreateThread doesn't
register the new thread with the GC and instead redirects the
call directly to the windows CreateThread function.  This
does not occur if libgc is compiled using ming (e.g. with the
--no-cygwin compiler flag).  Threads that aren't registered
with the GC *will* eventaully segfault.  When compiled under
cygwin, libgc expects you to use pthreads and not windows
threads.

Portable.Net uses windows threads (and never pthreads) under
cygwin so the following changes needed to be made to libgc:

configure.in:

	Added AC_DEFINE(GC_DISABLE_CYGWIN_PTHREADS) when
	a cygwin compile is detected.
	
win32_threads.c:

	All checks for CYGWIN32 are changed to checks for
	CYGWIN32 && !defined(GC_DISABLE_CYGWIN_PTHREADS).
	
include/gc.h:

	GC_PTHREADS is defined if GC_WIN32_THREADS and 
	__CYGWIN32__ are defined but only if
	GC_DISABLE_CYGWIN_PTHREADS is not defined.


Other changes:

win32_threads.c:  MAX_THREADS increased to 1024.
